Internally, every GUI component are based off a `GUIElement` class. Not much is to be said about it, but please refer to its [original SDK Code](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/blob/master/sdk/include/sdk/os/gui/util.hpp) if you need to extends them.

The C++ classes wrap their C call to make them easier to use using virtual tables, as shown in the SDK.

It is thought that internally the GUI is based on an older version of [PEG - Portable Embded GUI](https://www.smxrtos.com/gui.htm), that is now NXP proprietary.
