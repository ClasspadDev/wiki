You can jump right to the [üë®‚Äçüíª Usage](#usage) or can refer to its [original SDK Code](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/blob/master/sdk/include/sdk/os/gui/dialog.hpp) if you need more details.

The `GUIDialog` is one of the most common way to compose visual elements, represented as a dialog window. It provides a simple way to create a dialog with a specified height, alignment, title, and keyboard state (if the keyboard is visible or not when opening). Dialogs can contain various elements, such as labels, buttons, and text boxes.

### Constructor

```cpp
GUIDialog(
    enum Height height,
    enum Alignment alignment,
    const char* title,
    enum KeyboardState keyboard
);
```
Creates a **dialog** with given title. Child element such as labels need to be added later with `AddElement()`.

## Enums

The `GUIDialog` class defines the following enums:

### Height
Height is the percentage of the screen taken by the dialog. Possible values are:
- `Height25`
- `Height35`
- `Height55`
- `Height60`
- `Height75`
- `Height95`

### Alignment
- `AlignTop`
- `AlignCenter`
- `AlignBottom`

### KeyboardState
Indicate in which state the keyboard should be when the dialog is shown. Values are: 
- `KeyboardStateNone` (keyboard is hidden)
- `KeyboardStateMath1`
- `KeyboardStateMath2`
- `KeyboardStateMath3`
- `KeyboardStateTrig`
- `KeyboardStateVar`
- `KeyboardStateABC`
- `KeyboardStateCatalog`
- `KeyboardStateAdvance`
- `KeyboardStateNumber`

### DialogResult
- `DialogResultOK`
- `DialogResultCancel`

## Member Functions

- `int OnEvent(struct GUIDialog_Wrapped *dialog, struct GUIDialog_OnEvent_Data *event);`
- `uint16_t GetLeftX();`
- `uint16_t GetTopY();`
- `uint16_t GetRightX();`
- `uint16_t GetBottomY();`
- `void AddElement(GUIElement &element);`
- `void Refresh();`
- `DialogResult ShowDialog();`

## Usage

This element is used in both the [main launcher](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/blob/1666f4b55d80b6f50d12f3414bec94d4fe58ff94/launcher/main.cpp#L14) and the [demo gui](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/blob/1666f4b55d80b6f50d12f3414bec94d4fe58ff94/demos/demo_gui/main.cpp#L8)

### Display a Simple Dialog with a Label

```cpp
GUIDialog dialog(
    GUIDialog::Height25, GUIDialog::AlignTop,
    "Dialog Title",
    GUIDialog::KeyboardStateABC
);

GUILabel label(
    dialog.GetLeftX() + 10,
    dialog.GetTopY() + 10,
    "Label Text"
);
dialog.AddElement(label);

dialog.ShowDialog();
```
