description: Functions for interacting with the calculator's file system.
---

The file operations API provides a set of functions to interact with the calculator's file system, similar to Unix.

The storage accessible when the calculator is connected to a PC can be found under the path `\fls0\`. It is also possible to read from `\drv0\` if you have a SDCard and made a hardware mod on the calculator.

The storage can be **slow** and sometimes **unreliable** for large files or frequent read/writes.

## Methods

### Basic file operations

Most of the file operations are similar to Unix and use the same concepts (file descriptor ...)

#### Open 

```cpp
int open(const char *path, int flags);
```
Opens a file on the file system.
The argument `flags` is fed a bitwise OR'd combination of flags.
Flag are among:
- `OPEN_READ`
- `OPEN_WRITE`
- `OPEN_CREATE`
- `OPEN_APPEND`

See the [open_flags_values](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/blob/master/sdk/include/sdk/os/file.hpp#L105) 

#### Read 

```cpp
int read(int fd, void *buf, int count);
```
Reads up to `count` bytes from a file, and stores them in `buf`. 

If `count` bytes cannot be read from the file, as many bytes as possible are read (i.e. between 0 and `count - 1` bytes are read and stored in `buf`).
`fd` is a file handle that you get from using `open()`.

Returns the number of bytes read on success, or a negative error code on failure.

#### Write 

```cpp
int write(int fd, const void *buf, int count);
```
Writes `count` bytes from `buf` to a file.
`fd` is a file handle that you get from using `open()`.

Returns the number of bytes written on success, or a negative error code on failure.

#### Close 

```cpp
int close(int fd);
```
Closes an open file.

`fd` is a file handle that you get from using `open()`.
Don't try to double-close a file, it can make the storage crash.

Returns 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.

#### Remove 

```cpp
int remove(const char *path);
```
Deletes a file or directory.

`path` is the path to the file or directory to be deleted.

Returns 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.

#### Rename 

```cpp
int rename(const char *oldPath, const char *newPath);
```
Renames a file or directory.

`oldPath` is the path to the file or directory to be renamed to `newPath`.

Returns 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.

#### Create directory

```cpp
int mkdir(const char *path);
```
Creates a directory.

`path` is the path to the  directory to be created.

Returns 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.

### Find handles

#### Find First
```cpp
int findFirst(const wchar_t *path, int *findHandle, wchar_t *name, struct findInfo *findInfoBuf);
```
Starts a find operation, locating files matching a specific path.

Can be used to list the contents of a directory by using a wildcard. For example, passing the path `"\fls0\*"` or `"\fls0\*.*"` matches all files and directories on the calculator's flash (not recursive, though).

To find the next file/directory which matches the path, call `findNext`, passing in the find handle returned by this function. Ensure the find handle is closed using `findClose` when the find operation is finished. Bad things happen if the handle is not closed.

- `path` to search. May contain wildcards.
- `findHandle` is created. Must be closed when the find operation is finished.
- `name` of the first file/directory found. Call `findNext` to get the next one.
- `findInfoBuf` Information about the found file.


#### Find Next

```cpp
int findNext(int findHandle, wchar_t *name, struct findInfo *findInfoBuf);
```
Continues a find operation to locate the next file.

#### Close find session

```cpp
int findClose(int findHandle);
```
Closes a find handle. 

Very, very, very bad things happen if a find handle is not closed, so do not forget do close when done.

#### findInfoBuf

Information about a file/directory, as returned from `findFirst` or `findNext`:
- `type`: File (`0x1`) or Directory (`0x5`)
- `size`: Size of the entry in bytes (`uint32_t`). Zero on directories.

:::caution
Some of the find internals are still unkown and not well tested. You can [help us find out !](/wiki/dev/helping#studying-the-rom)

### Advanced file operations

#### Seek

```cpp
int lseek(int fd, int offset, int whence);
```
Seeking make you able to repositions the file offset of the file descriptor.

For more details on the usage, see the [lseek_whence_values](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/blob/master/sdk/include/sdk/os/file.hpp#L92) 

#### Stat

```cpp
int stat(const char *path, struct stat *buf);
```
Retrieves information about a file.

- `path` is the path to the file to retrieve the information of.
- `buf` contains the retrieved information about the file.

Returns 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.

The `stat` structure contains the following informations:
- `fileSize`: The size of the file, in bytes (`uint32_t`)
- `creationDate`: The creation date of the file (`uint16_t`)
- `creationTime`: The creation time of the file (`uint16_t`)
- `lastModifiedDate`: The date the file was last modified (`uint16_t`)
- `lastModifiedTime`: The time the file was last modified (`uint16_t`)
- `lastAccessedDate`: The date the file was last accessed (`uint16_t`)
More information on the date format are available on the [internal documentation](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/blob/master/sdk/include/sdk/os/file.hpp#L183)

```cpp
int fstat(int fd, struct stat *buf);
```
Works the same way that `stat` but uses an open file descriptor as handle.


#### Memory address

```cpp
int getAddr(int fd, int offset, const void **addr);
```
Retrieves the memory address of a file. If the file is empty or the offset would point outside of the file, `EINVAL` is returned.

- `fd` is the file descriptor of an open file
- `offset` to apply to the pointer to the file's data
- `addr` is the return address of the file's data

Returns 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.

## Helper Functions for Date and Time

Dates and times are stored as bitfields in the `stat` structure. The following helper functions can be used to extract meaningful values:

- **statDateYear**: Retrieves the year.
- **statDateMonth**: Retrieves the month.
- **statDateDay**: Retrieves the day.
- **statTimeHour**: Retrieves the hour.
- **statTimeMinute**: Retrieves the minute.
- **statTimeSecond**: Retrieves the second (maximum resolution of 2 seconds).


## Usage

### Reading 256 Bytes from a File

```cpp
int fd = open("\\fls0\\test.txt", OPEN_READ);
if (fd < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling open
    goto exit;
}

uint8_t buf[256];
int ret = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
if (ret < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling read
    close(fd);
    goto exit;
}

ret = close(fd);
if (ret < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling close
}

exit:
```

### Writing 16 Bytes to a Non-existent File

```cpp
int fd = open("\\fls0\\out.bin", OPEN_WRITE | OPEN_CREATE);
if (fd < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling open
    goto exit;
}

uint8_t buf[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0xA, 0xB, 0xC, 0xD, 0xE, 0xF};
int ret = write(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
if (ret < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling write
    close(fd);
    goto exit;
}

ret = close(fd);
if (ret < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling close
}

exit:
```

### Appending a Line to a File

```cpp
int fd = open("\\fls0\\append_test.txt", OPEN_WRITE | OPEN_APPEND);
if (fd < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling open
    goto exit;
}

const char *line = "This is a new line.\n";
int ret = write(fd, line, strlen(line));
if (ret < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling write
    close(fd);
    goto exit;
}

ret = close(fd);
if (ret < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling close
}

exit:
```

### Checking if a File is Empty

```cpp
int fd = open("\\fls0\\check_empty.txt", OPEN_READ);
if (fd < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling open
    goto exit;
}

struct stat fileStat;
int ret = fstat(fd, &fileStat);
if (ret < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling fstat
    close(fd);
    goto exit;
}

bool isEmpty = (fileStat.fileSize == 0);

ret = close(fd);
if (ret < 0) {
    // An error occurred calling close
}

exit:
```
