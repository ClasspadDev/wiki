description: Functions used for sending and receiving serial data.
---

Serial communication functions allow for sending and receiving data through the 3Pin serial port (the small jack-like port).

The functions provided here are similar to those on the Casio fx-CG50 calculator and follow the implementations found in the [libfxcg library](https://github.com/Jonimoose/libfxcg/blob/master/include/fxcg/serial.h).


## Methods

### Open Serial

Opens the 3-pin serial port with the specified parameters.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_Open(unsigned char *mode);
```

- **Parameters**: `mode` - An array specifying the serial port settings.
  - `mode[0]`: Always 0.
  - `mode[1]`: Bit rate (e.g., 5 for 9600 bps).
  - `mode[2]`: Parity (0=none, 1=odd, 2=even).
  - `mode[3]`: Data length (0=8bit, 1=7bit).
  - `mode[4]`: Stop bits (0=1bit, 1=2bit).
  - `mode[5]`: Always 0.
- **Returns**: 
  - `0` on success.
  - `3` if already open.


See [Prizm's Serial_Open](https://prizm.cemetech.net/index.php?title=Serial_Open) for more info.

### Is Serial Open

Checks if the serial port is open.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_IsOpen(void);
```

- **Returns**: `1` if the serial port is open, `0` otherwise.

### Close Serial

Closes the serial port.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_Close(int mode);
```

- **Parameters**: `mode` - The mode to close the serial port.
- **Returns**: `0` on success.

### Read Serial

Reads a specified number of bytes from the serial port.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_Read(unsigned char *out, int sz, short *count);
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `out` - Pointer to the buffer to store the read data.
  - `sz` - Number of bytes to read.
  - `count` - Pointer to a variable to store the number of bytes actually read.
- **Returns**: `0` on success.

### Read Serial Single Byte

Reads a single byte from the serial port.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_ReadSingle(unsigned char *out);
```

- **Parameters**: `out` - Pointer to store the read byte.
- **Returns**: `0` on success.

### Peek Serial

Peeks at a byte in the serial buffer without removing it.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_Peek(int idx, unsigned char *out);
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `idx` - The index of the byte to peek at.
  - `out` - Pointer to store the peeked byte.
- **Returns**: `0` on success.

### Poll Serial RX

Polls the receive buffer for available data.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_PollRX(void);
```

- **Returns**: The number of bytes available in the receive buffer.

### Clear Serial RX

Clears the receive buffer.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_ClearRX(void);
```

- **Returns**: `0` on success.

### Write Serial

Writes a specified number of bytes to the serial port.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_Write(const unsigned char *buf, int count);
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `buf` - Pointer to the buffer containing the data to be sent.
  - `count` - Number of bytes to send.
- **Returns**: `0` on success.


See [Prizm's Serial_Write](https://prizm.cemetech.net/index.php?title=Serial_Write) for more info.

### Write Serial Single Byte

Writes a single byte to the serial port.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_WriteSingle(unsigned char x);
```

- **Parameters**: `x` - The byte to be sent.
- **Returns**: `0` on success.

### Write Unbuffered Serial

Writes a single byte to the serial port without buffering.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_WriteUnbuffered(unsigned char x);
```

- **Parameters**: `x` - The byte to be sent.
- **Returns**: `0` on success.

### Poll Serial TX

Polls the transmit buffer for space.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_PollTX(void);
```

- **Returns**: The number of bytes available in the transmit buffer.

### Clear Serial TX

Clears the transmit buffer.

```c
extern "C"
int Serial_ClearTX(void);
```

- **Returns**: `0` on success.

## Usage

:::tip[Note]
You would need a serial adapter and a reader for this to work

### Opening and Closing the Serial Port

```c
#include <sdk/os/serial.hpp>
#include <sdk/os/debug.hpp>

void example_serial_open_close() {
    unsigned char mode[6] = {0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0}; // 9600 bps, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit
    int result = Serial_Open(mode);
    if (result == 0) {
        Debug_Printf(0,0,false,0,"Serial port opened successfully\n");
    } else if (result == 3) {
        Debug_Printf(0,0,false,0,"Serial port already open\n");
    }

    result = Serial_Close(0);
    if (result == 0) {
        Debug_Printf(0,1,false,0,"Serial port closed successfully\n");
    }
}
```

### Sending and Receiving Data

```c
#include <sdk/os/serial.hpp>
#include <sdk/os/debug.hpp>

void example_serial_communication() {
    unsigned char mode[6] = {0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0}; // 9600 bps, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit
    Serial_Open(mode);

    unsigned char send_data[] = "Hello, Serial!";
    Serial_Write(send_data, sizeof(send_data));

    unsigned char recv_data[20];
    short count;
    Serial_Read(recv_data, 20, &count);

    Debug_Printf(0,0,false,0,"Received %d bytes: %s\n", count, recv_data);

    Serial_Close(0);
}
```
