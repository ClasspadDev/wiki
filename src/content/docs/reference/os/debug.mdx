:::tip[Debug Methods]
Those methods are not made to be used in a normal calculator usage.

It is still possible to rely on them, but please consider alternatives (Like GUI) before doing `Debug_Printf`.

Check them on the [Usage](#usage) and [original SDK Code](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/blob/master/sdk/include/sdk/os/debug.hpp)
:::


## Overview
Debug methods should be called inside a prepared environment, so be sure to do both a `calcInit()`, `calcEnd()` and some manual `LCD_Refresh()` when using them.

Some of the debug methods use a cursor position internally, which can be changed using `Debug_SetCursorPosition`. Units are character size and not pixels, so setting the cursor at `(1,1)` means the second line second character.

## Methods

### Set Cursor Position
```cpp
void Debug_GetCursorPosition(int x, int y);
void Debug_GetCursorPosition(int *x, int *y);
```
`x` and `y` are the position of the cursor in character size.

### Print String
```cpp
bool Debug_PrintString(const char *string, bool invert);
```
Prints a `string` in debug text mode, either in normal black-on-white or inverted white-on-black (controlled by the `invert` parameter)

### Print Advanced String
```cpp
void Debug_Printf(int x, int y, bool invert, int zero, const char *format, ...);
```
Print a formatted string in small debug text mode, either in normal black-on-white or inverted white-on-black (controlled by the `invert` parameter)

Supports most format specifiers:
- `%s` for strings
- `%d` for decimals

Check the [Usage](#usage) on how to use it.

### Print Hex
```cpp
void Debug_PrintNumberHex_Nibble(uint8_t value, int x, int y);
void Debug_PrintNumberHex_Byte(uint8_t value, int x, int y);
void Debug_PrintNumberHex_Word(uint16_t value, int x, int y);
void Debug_PrintNumberHex_Dword(uint32_t value, int x, int y);
```
Depending on the `value`:
- nibble are 4-bit number
- byte are 8-bit number
- word are 16-bit number
- Dword are 32-bit number


### Waits for a key
```cpp
int Debug_WaitKey();
```
Waits until a key is pressed, then returns a number representing the key.

More details about its return and behavior in the [SDK source code](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/blob/master/sdk/include/sdk/os/debug.hpp#L126)




## Usage 
```cpp
// Print "Hello, world!" at 0, 0 in black on white
Debug_SetCursorPosition(0, 0);
Debug_PrintString("Hello, world!", false);

// Print "Inverted text" at 1, 1 in white on black
Debug_SetCursorPosition(1, 1);
Debug_PrintString("Inverted text", true);

// Print the number 0x1322 at 3, 7
Debug_PrintNumberHex_Word(0x1322, 3, 7);

// Print small text with a format string
Debug_Printf(10, 10, false, 0, "Just one number : %d", 42);
Debug_Printf(20, 20, false, 0, "Format strings are %s in %d!", "cool", 2018);

// Draw the changes we made to VRAM onto the LCD
// Defined in sdk/os/lcd.hpp
LCD_Refresh();

// Block until the user presses a key
Debug_WaitKey();
```
