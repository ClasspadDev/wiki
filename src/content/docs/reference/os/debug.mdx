It can be useful to print text or numbers to the screen whilst debugging, without creating a full GUI, or pause execution and wait for a key press.
Thoroughly recommended only for debugging - prefer GUI elements for user-facing input/output!
```cpp
// Print "Hello, world!" at 0, 0 in black on white
Debug_SetCursorPosition(0, 0);
Debug_PrintString("Hello, world!", false);

// Print "Inverted text" at 1, 1 in white on black
Debug_SetCursorPosition(1, 1);
Debug_PrintString("Inverted text", true);

// Print the number 0x1322 at 3, 7
Debug_PrintNumberHex_Word(0x1322, 3, 7);

// Print small text with a format string
Debug_Printf(20, 20, false, 0, "Format strings are %s in %d!", "cool", 2018);

// Draw the changes we made to VRAM onto the LCD
// Defined in sdk/os/lcd.hpp
LCD_Refresh();

// Block until the user presses a key
Debug_WaitKey();
```
