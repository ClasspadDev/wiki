description: Functions used for modifying and allocating memory.
---

Memory functions are advanced tools in programming, allowing you to dynamically allocate, manage, and manipulate memory.

These functions are similar to those provided by the C standard library and include functions for allocating memory (`malloc`), freeing memory (`free`), copying memory (`memcpy`), and setting memory (`memset`).

### Dangers of direct memory modification

Improper use of memory functions can lead to various issues:
- **Memory Leaks**: Failing to free allocated memory can cause your application to consume increasing amounts of memory.
- **Buffer Overflows**: Copying more data than the allocated space can hold can overwrite adjacent memory, causing unpredictable behavior or crashes.
- **Undefined Behavior**: Using memory after it has been freed or accessing memory beyond allocated regions can lead to undefined behavior.

## Methods

### malloc

Allocates a specified number of bytes of memory.

```c
extern "C"
void *malloc(uint32_t size);
```

- **Parameters**: `size` - The number of bytes to allocate.
- **Returns**: A pointer to the allocated memory.

### free

Frees memory that was previously allocated with `malloc`.

```c
extern "C"
void free(void *ptr);
```

- **Parameters**: `ptr` - The pointer to the memory to free.

### memcpy

Copies a specified number of bytes from a source memory location to a destination memory location.

```c
extern "C"
void *memcpy(void *destination, const void *source, int num);
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `destination` - The pointer to the destination memory location.
  - `source` - The pointer to the source memory location.
  - `num` - The number of bytes to copy.
- **Returns**: A pointer to the destination memory location.

### memset

Sets a specified number of bytes in a memory location to a given value.

```c
extern "C"
void *memset(void *ptr, int value, int num);
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `ptr` - The pointer to the memory location.
  - `value` - The value to set.
  - `num` - The number of bytes to set.
- **Returns**: A pointer to the memory location.

## Usage

### Allocating and Freeing Memory

```c
#include <sdk/os/mem.hpp>
#include <sdk/os/debug.hpp>

void example_malloc_free() {
    // Allocate 100 bytes of memory
    void *ptr = malloc(100);
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        Debug_Printf(0,0,false,0, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        return;
    }

    Debug_Printf(0,0,false,0, "Memory allocated at %p", ptr);

    // Free the allocated memory
    free(ptr);
    Debug_Printf(0,1,false,0, "Memory freed");
}
```

### Copying Memory with `memcpy`

```c
#include <sdk/os/mem.hpp>
#include <sdk/os/debug.hpp>

void example_memcpy() {
    char source[] = "Hello, World!";
    char destination[20];

    // Copy the contents of source to destination
    memcpy(destination, source, sizeof(source));

    Debug_Printf(0,0,false,0, "Source: %s", source);
    Debug_Printf(0,1,false,0, "Destination: %s", destination);
}
```

#### Setting Memory with `memset`

```c
#include <sdk/os/mem.hpp>
#include <sdk/os/debug.hpp>

void example_memset() {
    char buffer[20];

    // Set the first 10 bytes of buffer to 'A'
    memset(buffer, 'A', 10);
    buffer[10] = '\0'; // Null-terminate the string for printing

    Debug_Printf(0,0,false,0, "Buffer after memset: %s", buffer);
}
```
