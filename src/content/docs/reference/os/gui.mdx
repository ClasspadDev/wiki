__Example:__ Display a simple dialog with a label

![The dialog as shown on the calculator, with "Dialog Title" as title and "Label Text" as body](/wiki/img/gui/dialog_label.png)

Here we are using a [GUIDialog](../../gui/dialog/) that's wrapping a [GUILabel](../../gui/label/). The code should look like this : 

```cpp
GUIDialog dialog(
    GUIDialog::Height25,
    GUIDialog::AlignTop,
    "Dialog Title",
    GUIDialog::KeyboardStateABC
);

GUILabel label(
    dialog.GetLeftX() + 10,
    dialog.GetTopY() + 10,
    "Label Text"
);
dialog.AddElement(label);

dialog.ShowDialog();
```
Where the [Height25](../../gui/dialog/#Height25) means 1/4 of the screen height, and [AlignTop](../../gui/dialog/#AlignTop) that it'll be top-aligned, fixed to screen top.
The [KeyboardStateABC](../../gui/dialog/#KeyboardStateABC) is a flag indicating what the keyboard should display if called on this dialog. Here the "ABC" tells it'll be the standard "abc" keyboard when pressing the "Keyboard" key.
