HollyHock2 operates as a modification (mod) for Classpad calculators, utilizing a **custom ROM** for enhanced functionality to make your calculator do even more **awesome things**. To make HHK work, you gotta **install it on your calculator**. If you haven't done this yet, we have a **simple guide** to help you out. Just go to our **[üõ†Ô∏è calculator patching guide](/wiki/reference/install/)** to learn how to do it.

## Instant Coding using online codespace

The **easiest way** to start is by setting up a **Github Codespace**. You'll get **coding instantly** without the hassle of installations or long downloads. **No need for local setups**‚Äîour integrated online IDE with Git makes coding a breeze. Follow our **step-by-step guide** in our online sandboxes to get your **app from code to ready** to use app:

> *If GitHub prompts for login, you'll need to **create a GitHub account** to use Codespaces. Don't worry, it's a **quick and free** process! Plus, enjoy 120 hours of free usage per month ‚Äì more than enough to dive into coding, create cool apps, and kickstart your development journey*.

For advanced users, alternative methods are available, but **for beginners**, we highly **recommend** starting with **Codespaces** for the **quickest and user-friendly experience**. Dive into **coding effortlessly** and build your projects with confidence by taking a look at the **following tutorial** :

*Below that point are instructions for **advanced users**. You may skip them if you have successfuly setup the codespace.*

## Docker Setup 

:::caution
Using docker is currently a **WIP feature**, as it powers the Github codespace as it and **is not battle tested**.
You may need **extra setup** to get it work with your workflow
:::

If you need to troubleshoot or adapt this Docker image, you can take a look at [the source of the DevEnv](https://github.com/TheRainbowPhoenix/sh4-devenv-gitpod).

First you'll need to pull the latest release of the SH4 devenv :

`docker pull pho3be/sh4devenvgitpod`

Then run a bash, and you'll get into the docker image :

`docker run -it -p 8080:8080 pho3be/sh4devenvgitpod bash`

You can now clone a template and start building

```bash
su - dev
# password is dev
git clone https://github.com/TheRainbowPhoenix/CPAppTemplate.git
cd CPAppTemplate
ls
# you don't have the app or anything
cat WELCOME.txt
make all
ls
# now you have both the .bin and .hhk ready to get installed onto your classpad !
```

You may want to setup the [VSCode remote host](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/develop-remote-host), use the default [VSCode devcontainers configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), or even go with a [custom code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server)

### Docker and code-server

With code-server you may need to `sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl` first.

Then install code-server with `curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh`

Take note of the code-server password on `cat /home/dev/.config/code-server/config.yaml`

Finally run it with `code-server --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080`

You can now open your browser to the [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080), enter the password.

VS Code should prompt you to install recommended extensions. I advise you to do so as they'll make your development experience a breeze !

Accept when asked about "installing clangd" and reload the window. Then it should be okay !

## Using the pre-built compiler
:::tip
The pre-built is tailored for **Windows** users only ‚Äì *for now*.
:::

To use the pre-built compiler for HollyHock2, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the Files:**
   Go to [SH4-cross-mingw Releases](https://github.com/TheRainbowPhoenix/SH4-cross-mingw/releases) and download three files:
   - `build-all.zip`: Contains SH4 gcc for Windows and some helpers.
   - `tests.zip`: Includes test projects, build scripts, and make.
   - `hollyhock-2.zip`: The compiled SDK with the source.

2. **Create a Folder:**
   Create a new folder on your computer and name it, for example, "hhk".

3. **Extract Files:**
   - Extract the contents of `build-all.zip`. The "out" folder should be extracted to the root of your "hhk" folder.
   - Extract the contents of `hollyhock-2.zip` to the root of the "hhk" folder.
   - Extract the contents of `tests.zip` to the "hhk" folder.

4. **Prepare for Build:**
   Navigate to the `tests/CPAppTemplate-main` folder and remove the `.hhk` and `.bin` files.

5. **Open CMD:**
   Open a Command Prompt (CMD) at the path of `tests/CPAppTemplate-main`:
   - Navigate to the folder's address bar, type "cmd", and press Enter.

6. **Build the App:**
   In the Command Prompt, type and execute the command: `build.bat`. This will build the app `hhk` and `bin`.

Your development environment is now set up, and you can start exploring and building with HollyHock2.
