import { LinkCard, CardGrid, Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

If your devev is ready to be used, you shall be able to run the `make` command from the command line.  

Building your Classpad app involves using the `make` command, a powerful tool for automating the compilation process.
When you run `make bin`, it compiles your source code into a binary file.
Similarly, `make hhk` generates an elf file for HollyHock2 but thoses are not recommended anymore.

## On the codespace / remote VSCode

From the "**Explorer**" (*Ctrl + Shift + E*) panel at the top left, right click on the "main.cpp" file and choose "**Open in integrated terminal**"

![Right click on the "main.cpp" and open in terminal](/wiki/img/tutorials/main-open-in-term.png)

Inside the terminal, enter the following text : `make bin`

You should now see a file on the tree view ending with "**.bin**" (maybe *app_template.bin*). Right click on it and choose "**Download...**"

Now, **plug your calculator** and put this file on the **root folder of the calculator** (not the *Autoimport*, the very **root folder that opens**).

Finally, unplug your calculator and on the *menu → System → Hollyhock-2 Launcher* and you should see your app on the list.

:::tip[Not seeing your app ?]
The app should be present on the **root of the calculator**, not into a subfolder. 
Also, there's **sometime error** while copying the file. If so **try again one more time** just to be sure.
