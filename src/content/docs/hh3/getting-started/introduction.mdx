HollyHock3 (successor of HollyHock2) operates as a modification (mod) for Classpad calculators, utilizing a **custom ROM** for enhanced functionality to make your calculator do even more **awesome things**. To make HHK work, you gotta **install it on your calculator**. If you haven't done this yet, we have a **simple guide** to help you out. Just go to our **[üõ†Ô∏è calculator patching guide](/wiki/reference/install/)** to learn how to do it.

## HollyHock-3 Beta (V3)

:::caution[Beta Version]
HollyHock-3 (V3) is currently in **beta development**. We're actively moving packages and applications to the new version, so some features may not work completely as expected. Stay tuned for the official V3 release when everything is fully functional!
:::

HollyHock-3 represents the next generation of Classpad development with improved performance, better SDK organization, and enhanced tooling capabilities. While we're working hard to make everything compatible, you may encounter some differences from V2.

### V3 Templates

For those wanting to try the new V3 beta, tThe **easiest way** to start is by setting up a **Github Codespace**. You'll get **coding instantly** without the need to download or configure anything on your computer.

We currently have two template options:

<CardGrid>
    <div class="card-app">
        <LinkCard
            title="üì± HHK3 Basic Template"
            href="https://github.com/QBos07/HHK3template"
            description="Basic template for HollyHock-3 development without additional libraries"
        />
    </div>
    <div class="card-game">
        <LinkCard
            title="üé® HHK3 UI Template"
            href="https://github.com/QBos07/HHK3template/tree/ugfx"
            description="Template with uGFX library for advanced UI development in HollyHock-3"
        />
    </div>
</CardGrid>

> *If GitHub prompts for login, you'll need to **create a GitHub account** to use Codespaces. Don't worry, it's a **quick and free** process! Plus, enjoy 120 hours of free usage per month ‚Äì more than enough to dive into coding, create cool apps, and kickstart your development journey*.


For advanced users, alternative methods are available, but **for beginners**, we highly **recommend** starting with **Codespaces** for the **quickest and user-friendly experience**. Dive into **coding effortlessly** and build your projects with confidence by taking a look at the **tutorial**


### Understanding the Changes

To better understand what's changed in V3, you can compare the CPDoom migration:

<LinkCard

        href="https://github.com/diddyholz/CPDoom"
        description="Original V2 version of CPDoom for comparison with V3 changes"
/>

:::note[Coming Soon]
Python support will be ported to HHK3 (V3) in a later update. We're focusing on core SDK first.

## Advanced Development Setup

For advanced users who want to create custom development environments or CI/CD pipelines, you can easily build Docker images from our toolchain:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/classpaddev/hollyhock-3:v2.1.1 AS toolchain

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:debian12 AS base

# Install required packages KEEP IN SYNC (+clangd bear python nano)
RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    make libncurses6 zstd zlib1g \
    gawk wget bzip2 xz-utils unzip \
    patch libstdc++6 rsync git mold \
    nano clangd-19 bear python3 python-is-python3
RUN apt-get install -y --reinstall ca-certificates
COPY --from=toolchain /toolchain /toolchain
COPY --from=toolchain /sdk /sdk
ENV PATH=$PATH:/toolchain/bin
ENV SDK_DIR=/sdk
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Example

You can also set up automated builds using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: C/C++ CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

jobs:
  build:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ghcr.io/classpaddev/hollyhock-3:v2.1.1
      credentials:
       username: ${{ github.actor }}
       password: ${{ secrets.github_token }}

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: make
      run: make
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        path: dist
```
