If your devev is ready to be used, you shall be able to run the `make` command from the command line.  

Building your Classpad app involves using the `make` command, a powerful tool for automating the compilation process.
When you run `make`, it compiles your source code into both elf and HH3 files.
The HH3 format is the recommended format for HollyHock-3.

## On the codespace / remote VSCode

From the "**Explorer**" (*Ctrl + Shift + E*) panel at the top left, right click on the "main.cpp" file and choose "**Open in integrated terminal**"

![Right click on the "main.cpp" and open in terminal](/wiki/img/tutorials/main-open-in-term.png)

First time only, enter `make compile_commands.json` in the terminal (or use the vscode task)

Restart clangd via CTRL+SHIFT+P in vscode, by entering `> restar` and picking "clangd: Restart..." 

Then, inside the terminal, enter the following text : `make -j`

You should now see a `dist` folder on the tree view containing a file ending with "**.hh3**" (like *CPapp.hh3*). Right click on it and choose "**Download...**"

Now, **plug your calculator** and put this file on the **root folder of the calculator** (not the *Autoimport*, the very **root folder that opens**).

Finally, unplug your calculator and on the *menu → System → Hollyhock Launcher* and you should see your app on the list.

:::tip[Not seeing your app ?]
The app should be present on the **root of the calculator**, not into a subfolder. 
Also, there's **sometime error** while copying the file. If so **try again one more time** just to be sure. 
:::

To change the file name, open the Makefile and adjust this line to what you want:
```Makefile
APP_ELF := $(OUTDIR)/<your_file_name>.elf
```
