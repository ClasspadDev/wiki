Welcome to the **uGUI** documentation! uGUI is an embedded, lightweight graphical user interface module written in C. This v3 iteration integrates deeply with ClassPad OS elements to provide high-performance windowing, buttons, sliders, input fields, and native OS keyboard support.

If you are looking for an elegant, widget-based approach for your ClassPad graphical add-ins, uGUI makes it remarkably straightforward.
