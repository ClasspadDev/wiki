Welcome to the **JustUI** documentation! JustUI is a powerful, event-driven user interface library designed for Casio calculators running `gint`. It abstracts away pixel-by-pixel rendering and provides elegant, flexible layouts using VBoxes, HBoxes, and Stacks, alongside interactive touch-friendly components.

The library is also used on other calculator, so you may already be familiar with its syntax.

## Start Learning

If you are new to JustUI, we highly recommend starting with the tutorial. It will guide you step-by-step from an empty screen to a fully functioning multi-tab graphical application.
