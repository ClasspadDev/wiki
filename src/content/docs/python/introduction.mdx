PythonExtra is a custom Python runtime made for ClassPad calculators, built on top of the [**gint kernel**](https://git.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/gint#readme).  
It lets you build games, utilities, and animations using **pure Python**, while accessing low-level screen rendering, key input, and more ‚Äî all optimized for performance.

If you‚Äôre just getting started, **no setup is needed**.  
Just open your Codespace or use your favorite editor and you‚Äôre ready to write Python code that runs directly on your calculator!

:::tip[What can PythonExtra do?]
With PythonExtra, you can:
- Draw pixels, rectangles, circles, and text
- Read key presses for making interactive programs
- Display images and animations
- Build games with fast screen refresh

## Instant start with Codespaces

The **fastest way** to start using PythonExtra is with our pre-configured GitHub Codespace.

You don‚Äôt need to install anything locally ‚Äî just open a project in the browser and start coding:

<CardGrid>
  <div class="card-app">
    <LinkCard
      title="üêç Python template"
      href="https://github.com/TheRainbowPhoenix/pythonextra-template"
      description="Pre-configured Codespace to build PythonExtra apps"
    />
  </div>
  {/* <div class="card-game">
    <LinkCard
      title="üéÆ Game template"
      href="https://github.com/TheRainbowPhoenix/CPGameTemplate#cpgametemplate"
      description="Start building interactive games in Python"
    />
  </div> */}
</CardGrid>

## Beginner Tutorials

These tutorials will walk you through the essentials of PythonExtra ‚Äî from printing your first message to creating animated programs.

### Step 1: Drawing Your First Rectangle

Learn how to:
- Draw a custom logo made of text
- Move it across the screen
- Bounce it off screen borders
- Exit the program on key press

/>

---

### Step 2: Drawing and Colors

Learn to draw colored shapes, fill the screen, and use screen coordinates with precision. Perfect for starting any visual project.

  href="/wiki/python/examples/color-shapes/"
  description="How to draw rectangles, lines, and circles using gint"
/>

---

### Step 3: Handling Input

In this tutorial, you‚Äôll make a simple game where you move a shape around with the keyboard. It covers real-time input with `pollevent()` and `keydown()`.

### Step 4: Bouncing Logo

Learn how to:
- Draw a custom logo made of text
- Move it across the screen
- Bounce it off screen borders
- Exit the program on key press

### Step 5: Snake ? Snaaake !

Put everything you learnt in practice with the classical "Snake" game

### Step 6: Drawing Images

Use tools like [`fxconv`](/wiki/python/reference/fxconv/) to convert real images into Python data and draw them on screen.

## What‚Äôs next?

If you're comfortable with drawing, input, and animation, try combining them into your own game or app. PythonExtra is capable of running surprisingly complex things ‚Äî and you can always peek at sample projects like:

/>


### Technical Documentation

Want to dive into the internals and low-level functions?

Check out the full [**technical documentation**](https://git.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/PythonExtra/src/branch/main/docs/sh/modgint-en.md)  
(*also available in [french for some reason](https://git.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/PythonExtra/src/branch/main/docs/sh/modgint-fr.md) üá´üá∑*)


There‚Äôs also [**casioplot**](https://git.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/PythonExtra/src/branch/main/docs/sh/modcasioplot-en.md) module.
Not really great for games, but might be useful in other contexts!

### Try Drawing Code Online

Want to quickly test simple drawing code (like `gint.drect`, `gint.dpixel`, `gint.dcircle`, etc.)?

You can use the **PythonExtra REPL (beta)** here:  
[üåê python-extra-repl](https://therainbowphoenix.github.io/python-extra-repl/)

‚ö†Ô∏è This REPL only supports **drawing commands**.  
Functions like `gint.getkey()` or `gint.pollevent()` won‚Äôt work.  
Avoid infinite loops like `while True:`. You've been warned.


### All the Examples

Want more sample code?

All examples can be found here:  
üîó [https://git.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/PythonExtra/src/branch/main/ports/sh/examples](https://git.planet-casio.com/Lephenixnoir/PythonExtra/src/branch/main/ports/sh/examples)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: some of these aren't tailored specifically for the ClassPad, so you might need to tweak them.
