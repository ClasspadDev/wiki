In this short tutorial, you'll learn how to use the **touchscreen** to interact with your program.

We‚Äôll make a simple **drawing app**:  
- Drag your finger to draw lines  
- Press [EXE] to clear  
- Press [CLEAR] to exit

---

## How it works

ClassPad touch input is handled through the **event system**, just like keys.  
You can listen to:

- `KEYEV_TOUCH_DOWN`: when your finger touches the screen  
- `KEYEV_TOUCH_DRAG`: while you're dragging  
- `KEYEV_TOUCH_UP`: when you lift your finger

Each event has `.x` and `.y` fields for the position (in pixels).

---

## Step 1: Start with a blank screen

We create a function `clear()` that:
- Clears the screen
- Draws a helpful label at the top

```py
def clear():
    dclear(C_WHITE)
    dtext(2, 2, C_BLACK, "Touch: draw | EXE: clear | Clear: quit")
```

We then call it once at the beginning:

```py
clear()
dupdate()
```

---

## Step 2: Track Touch Position

We use two variables to remember the last touch location:

```py
x, y = -1, -1
```

Every time the screen is touched, we save where it started.

---

## Step 3: Event Loop

We use `pollevent()` to listen to input:

```py
ev = pollevent()
while ev.type != KEYEV_NONE:
    # Handle events...
    ev = pollevent()
```

This loop catches every type of input ‚Äî key presses and touches.

---

## Step 4: Drawing with your finger

```py
if ev.type == KEYEV_TOUCH_DOWN:
    x, y = ev.x, ev.y
```

This saves the **starting point** when you first touch the screen.

```py
if ev.type == KEYEV_TOUCH_DRAG:
    dline(x, y, ev.x, ev.y, C_BLACK)
    x, y = ev.x, ev.y
```

This draws a line between the last known point and the new one, creating a fluid pen stroke.

---

## Step 5: Keyboard controls

```py
if ev.type == KEYEV_DOWN and ev.key == KEY_EXE:
    clear()
```

Press [EXE] to **clear the screen** and restart drawing.

```py
if ev.type == KEYEV_DOWN and ev.key == KEY_EXIT:
    break
```

You can optionally add this to allow quitting with [CLEAR].

---

## Final Code

```py
from gint import *

def clear():
    dclear(C_WHITE)
    dtext(2, 2, C_BLACK, "Touch: draw | EXE: clear | Clear: quit")

clear()
dupdate()

x, y = -1, -1

while True:
    ev = pollevent()
    while ev.type != KEYEV_NONE:
        if ev.type == KEYEV_DOWN and ev.key == KEY_EXE:
            clear()
        if ev.type == KEYEV_TOUCH_DOWN:
            x, y = ev.x, ev.y
        if ev.type == KEYEV_TOUCH_DRAG:
            dline(x, y, ev.x, ev.y, C_BLACK)
            x, y = ev.x, ev.y
        ev = pollevent()
    dupdate()
```
