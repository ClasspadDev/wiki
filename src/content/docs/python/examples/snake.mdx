In this tutorial, we’ll recreate the classic **Snake game**, using everything you’ve learned so far: drawing, input, and screen updates.

You’ve already mastered how to draw rectangles, check key input, and update frames. Now we’ll combine all that into your **first full game**!

---

## How it works

Here’s the basic logic behind the Snake game:

1. The snake is made of a list of positions (x, y), starting with 1 segment
2. It moves in a direction on a grid
3. If it eats the apple, the snake grows
4. If it runs into itself or the wall — **game over**
5. We update and redraw everything every frame

---

## Grid and Layout

We divide the screen into a grid:

```py
GRID_W = 20
GRID_H = 20
CELL = 10
```

This gives us a 20×20 grid, with each square being `10×10` pixels.

We center the game on the screen using:

```py
OX = (DWIDTH - GRID_W * CELL) // 2
OY = (DHEIGHT - GRID_H * CELL) // 2
```

Then we define and draw the grid limits:

```py
C_GRAY = C_RGB(200, 200, 200)  # Light gray

while True:
    dclear(C_WHITE)
    
    # Draw grid border (kill zone) 
    drect(OX-1, OY-1, OX + GRID_W*CELL, OY-1, C_GRAY)        # Top border
    drect(OX-1, OY + GRID_H*CELL, OX + GRID_W*CELL, OY + GRID_H*CELL, C_GRAY)  # Bottom
    drect(OX-1, OY-1, OX-1, OY + GRID_H*CELL, C_GRAY)        # Left border
    drect(OX + GRID_W*CELL, OY-1, OX + GRID_W*CELL, OY + GRID_H*CELL, C_GRAY)  # Right
```

So everything is aligned properly regardless of screen size.

## Snake and Apple

The snake is stored as a list of coordinates:

```py
snake = [(GRID_W//2, GRID_H//2)]
```

It starts in the center of the grid.

The apple is just a random position on the grid:

```py
apple = (randint(0, GRID_W-1), randint(0, GRID_H-1))
```

We make sure the apple never spawns **on top of the snake** with `place_apple()`.

---

## Main Loop

This is the usual draw → input → update flow.

### 1. Drawing

We draw the background, the apple, and the snake:

```py
dclear(C_WHITE)
draw_cell(apple[0], apple[1], C_RED)
for x, y in snake:
    draw_cell(x, y, C_BLACK)
dupdate()
```

Each cell is drawn using `draw_cell()`, which uses `drect()` to draw one square.

---

### 2. Input

We read input with `pollevent()` and use a dictionary to turn arrow keys into directions:

```py
DIRS = {
    KEY_UP: (0, -1),
    KEY_DOWN: (0, 1),
    KEY_LEFT: (-1, 0),
    KEY_RIGHT: (1, 0),
}
```

Then we update the direction, unless the player is trying to reverse into themselves:

```py
if ev.type == KEYEV_DOWN and ev.key in DIRS:
    new_dir = DIRS[ev.key]
    if (new_dir[0] != -direction[0]) or (new_dir[1] != -direction[1]):
        direction = new_dir
```

---

### 3. Snake Movement

We calculate the new head position by adding the direction to the current head:

```py
head = (snake[0][0] + direction[0], snake[0][1] + direction[1])
```

Then we check for **collisions**:

- If the snake hits itself or the wall → `break`
- Otherwise, we add the new head to the front of the list

```py
if head in snake or not (0 <= head[0] < GRID_W and 0 <= head[1] < GRID_H):
    break  # Game over
```

If the snake eats the apple, we place a new one. Otherwise, we `pop()` the tail.

## Final Code

```py
from gint import *
from random import randint

# Grid size
GRID_W = 20
GRID_H = 20
CELL = 10

# Position offset to center the game
OX = (DWIDTH - GRID_W * CELL) // 2
OY = (DHEIGHT - GRID_H * CELL) // 2

# Directions: (dx, dy)
DIRS = {
    KEY_UP: (0, -1),
    KEY_DOWN: (0, 1),
    KEY_LEFT: (-1, 0),
    KEY_RIGHT: (1, 0),
}

C_GRAY = C_RGB(200, 200, 200)  # Light gray

snake = [(GRID_W//2, GRID_H//2)]
direction = (1, 0)  # Start moving right
apple = (randint(0, GRID_W-1), randint(0, GRID_H-1))

def draw_cell(x, y, color):
    x1 = OX + x * CELL
    y1 = OY + y * CELL
    drect(x1, y1, x1 + CELL - 1, y1 + CELL - 1, color)

def place_apple():
    while True:
        a = (randint(0, GRID_W-1), randint(0, GRID_H-1))
        if a not in snake:
            return a

while True:
    dclear(C_WHITE)

    # Draw grid border (kill zone) 
    drect(OX-1, OY-1, OX + GRID_W*CELL, OY-1, C_GRAY)        # Top border
    drect(OX-1, OY + GRID_H*CELL, OX + GRID_W*CELL, OY + GRID_H*CELL, C_GRAY)  # Bottom
    drect(OX-1, OY-1, OX-1, OY + GRID_H*CELL, C_GRAY)        # Left border
    drect(OX + GRID_W*CELL, OY-1, OX + GRID_W*CELL, OY + GRID_H*CELL, C_GRAY)  # Right

    # Draw apple
    draw_cell(apple[0], apple[1], C_RED)

    # Draw snake
    for x, y in snake:
        draw_cell(x, y, C_BLACK)

    dupdate()

    # Read input
    ev = pollevent()
    if ev.type == KEYEV_DOWN and ev.key in DIRS:
        new_dir = DIRS[ev.key]
        # Prevent reversing
        if (new_dir[0] != -direction[0]) or (new_dir[1] != -direction[1]):
            direction = new_dir
    elif ev.type == KEYEV_DOWN and ev.key == KEY_EXIT:
        break

    # Move snake
    head = (snake[0][0] + direction[0], snake[0][1] + direction[1])
    if head in snake or not (0 <= head[0] < GRID_W and 0 <= head[1] < GRID_H):
        break  # Game over

    snake.insert(0, head)
    if head == apple:
        apple = place_apple()
    else:
        snake.pop()

```
