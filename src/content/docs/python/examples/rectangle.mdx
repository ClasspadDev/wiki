import { LinkCard, CardGrid, Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


This is the most basic PythonExtra program you can write.  
Weâ€™ll draw a single rectangle on the screen and explain **each line** as we go.

You donâ€™t need any previous experience â€” weâ€™ll explain what a pixel is, how the screen works, and how to control it using `gint`.

---

## What youâ€™ll learn

- What is a pixel?
- How the calculator screen works
- How to clear the screen
- How to draw a filled rectangle
- How to update the screen to show your drawing

---

## Letâ€™s write the code!

```py
import gint
```

This line loads the **`gint`** module, which gives us access to:
- Drawing functions (pixels, rectangles, lines, etc.)
- Color constants (like white and black)
- Screen size (`gint.DWIDTH`, `gint.DHEIGHT`)
- Input events

Everything we draw will be using `gint`.

---

```py
gint.dclear(gint.C_WHITE)
```

This **clears the screen** by filling it with white (`C_WHITE`).  
Itâ€™s like starting with a blank canvas before drawing anything.

If we didnâ€™t do this, leftover graphics might still be visible.

---

```py
gint.drect(50, 80, 150, 130, gint.C_BLACK)
```

This draws a **filled rectangle** on the screen.

Letâ€™s break it down:

- `drect(x1, y1, x2, y2, color)`  
- `(50, 80)` is the **top-left corner** of the rectangle
- `(150, 130)` is the **bottom-right corner**
- `gint.C_BLACK` is the fill color

This draws a **black rectangle** from `(50, 80)` to `(150, 130)` on a white background.

---

### Wait, what is a pixel?

A **pixel** is one tiny dot on the screen.  
The calculator screen is made of hundreds of pixels arranged in a grid:

- The **top-left** pixel is `(0, 0)`
- The **bottom-right** pixel is `(319, 527)` on ClassPad models

So `(50, 80)` means:
- 50 pixels from the left
- 80 pixels from the top

The rectangle spans from that point to `(150, 130)` â€” making it 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall.

---

```py
gint.dupdate()
```

This tells the calculator to **actually show the drawing** on the screen.

Until you call `dupdate()`, everything is drawn **in memory**, not visible.  
You can think of it like clicking "Save" â€” this is the moment when all your drawing becomes visible.

---

```py
gint.getkey()
```

This line **waits for a key press** before the program exits.

Without it, the program would run, show the rectangle for a split second, then quit.

This gives the user a chance to see the screen and exit when theyâ€™re ready.

---

## Final code

Here is the full example all together:

```py
import gint

gint.dclear(gint.C_WHITE)
gint.drect(50, 80, 150, 130, gint.C_BLACK)
gint.dupdate()
gint.getkey()
```

Run this on your calculator, and you should see a black rectangle appear on a white screen.  
Press any key to exit the program.

## What's next?

Now that you can draw a rectangle, try changing the numbers and colors to see how it affects the shape!

Next up: Letâ€™s try adding more shapes.
