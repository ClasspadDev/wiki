description: Creating a Simple Animation That Bounces a Logo Across the Screen  
sidebar:
  order: 4
---

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll build a small animated program that makes a logo bounce around the screen, just like an old DVD screensaver.

You‚Äôll learn how to:
- Draw on the screen using `gint`
- Animate a logo by updating its position
- Detect screen edges to bounce off them
- Exit the program when a key is pressed

This guide is written with **beginners in mind**, so we‚Äôll explain everything step by step.

## Step 1: Create a New File

Open your Codespace and create a new file named `bounce.py`. This will be the program file we edit.     

If you don't have anything to code, we recommend using the [pythonextra-template](https://github.com/TheRainbowPhoenix/pythonextra-template) (it will include that file as example !)

---

## Step 2: Import the Needed Module

At the top of the file, start by importing the `gint` module:

```py
import gint
```

This module gives you everything you need to:
- Draw on the screen
- Work with colors
- Handle key input

We‚Äôll be using it throughout the program.

---

## Step 3: Define the Logo

Now, we‚Äôll create the image that will bounce around. It's made using **text characters**, and we‚Äôll later convert that into actual pixels on the screen.

```py
DVD = [
    "                       ",
    "   ####    ####        ",
    "  #       #    #       ",
    "  #       #    #       ",
    "  #       ######   ### ",
    "  #       #            ",
    "  #       #            ",
    "   ###    #            ",
    "                       ",
    "  ####   #####  #   #  ",
    "  #   #  #      #   #  ",
    "  #   #  #      #   #  ",
    "  #   #  #####  #   #  ",
    "  #   #  #       # #   ",
    "  #   #  #       # #   ",
    "  ####   #####    #    ",
]
```

Let‚Äôs break it down:

#### What is this?

- Each `"line of text"` is a **string**, which is just a sequence of characters.
- A bunch of strings, grouped in `[...]`, makes a **list**. Lists let us organize related items in order.

So this is a **list of strings**, and each character in those strings will become a **pixel**.

#### What do the characters mean?

- The `#` characters will become **black pixels**.
- The spaces (`" "`) will become **white pixels**.

Later, we‚Äôll read this list and draw pixels depending on the character at each spot.

We‚Äôll also define the **width and height** of the image so we can position and move it:

```py
DVD_W = 23
DVD_H = 16
```

---

## Step 4: Drawing the Logo on Screen

We want to draw the image starting at `(x, y)`, and go through each character in our logo.

- `dy` goes from top to bottom (each row of the image)
- `dx` goes left to right (each column of a row)
- `DVD[dy][dx]` gives us the character at that position (`#` or space)
- Depending on that character, we draw a black pixel or a white pixel

We also make sure that we don‚Äôt draw **outside the screen**.

To show the logo, we‚Äôll create a function that reads the list and draws it on screen:

```py
def draw_logo(x, y, color=gint.C_BLACK, bg=gint.C_WHITE):
    for dy in range(DVD_H):
        for dx in range(DVD_W):
            if 0 <= x+dx < gint.DWIDTH and 0 <= y+dy < gint.DHEIGHT:
                pixel = DVD[dy][dx]
                gint.dpixel(x+dx, y+dy, color if pixel == '#' else bg)
```

### How the screen works

The screen is a **grid of pixels**.

- Each **pixel** is a tiny dot on the screen that can have a color.
- The screen has **coordinates**, just like a map:
  - `x` is the horizontal axis (left to right)
  - `y` is the vertical axis (top to bottom)

You can think of `(x, y)` as saying "draw at column `x`, row `y`".

The screen size is:
```py
gint.DWIDTH  = 320   # width in pixels
gint.DHEIGHT = 528   # height in pixels
```

So `(0,0)` is the **top-left**, and `(319, 527)` is the **bottom-right**.

### Loops for Drawing

#### What is this part doing?

```py
for dy in range(DVD_H):
    for dx in range(DVD_W):
```

This is a **nested loop**. It goes through every row and column of the image:

- `dy` is the **row index** ‚Äî it starts at 0 and goes up to `DVD_H - 1` (in our case, 15).
- `dx` is the **column index** ‚Äî it starts at 0 and goes up to `DVD_W - 1` (in our case, 22).

This lets us visit **every character** of the logo, one by one, starting from the top-left.

---

### Accessing Characters with `DVD[dy][dx]`

Each element in `DVD` is a **string** (a line of text). So:

- `DVD[dy]` gives you a **line** of the image (like `"  #   #  "`).
- `DVD[dy][dx]` gives you the **character** at column `dx` of row `dy`.

If that character is a `"#"`, we want to draw a black pixel. Otherwise, we draw a white pixel.

```py
pixel = DVD[dy][dx]
```

### Avoid Drawing Outside the Screen

Before drawing, we need to make sure the pixel we're about to draw is still **on screen**.

```py
if 0 <= x+dx < gint.DWIDTH and 0 <= y+dy < gint.DHEIGHT:
```

Let‚Äôs break it down:

- `x+dx` is the **horizontal screen position** we want to draw at.
- `y+dy` is the **vertical screen position** we want to draw at.
- We only draw if:
  - `x+dx` is within the screen (not less than 0 or greater than screen width)
  - `y+dy` is within the screen (not less than 0 or greater than screen height)

This condition **protects us** from trying to draw off the screen, which could cause errors or weird bugs.

### What does `dpixel()` do?

```py
gint.dpixel(x, y, color)
```

This draws a **single pixel** at the given `(x, y)` position in the specified `color`.

### Actually Drawing the Pixel

```py
gint.dpixel(x+dx, y+dy, color if pixel == '#' else bg)
```

- If the current character is `"#"`, draw using the logo color (`color`)
- Otherwise, use the background color (`bg`)

The position on screen is calculated by adding `x` and `y` (the **top-left corner**) with `dx` and `dy` (the current pixel in the image).

This way, we can move the image to any position on screen by changing `x` and `y`.

---

## Step 5: Initialize the Animation

Now we prepare the animation.

```py
x, y = 50, 50
dx, dy = 2, 2
```

- `x` and `y` are the **current position** of the logo on screen
- `dx` and `dy` are the **movement speed** in pixels per frame
  - `2` means move by 2 pixels every frame

We‚Äôll also define the **colors** used:

```py
bg = gint.C_WHITE  # Background color
fg = gint.C_BLACK  # Foreground (logo) color
```

These are special color constants provided by `gint`.

---

## Step 6: The Main Loop

This part is the **core** of your program ‚Äî where everything comes alive and the logo starts moving around!

We call this an **animation loop**. The idea is simple:  
- Clear the screen  
- Draw the image at its new position  
- Show it  
- Move it  
- Repeat forever (or until the user exits)

Here‚Äôs the basic loop:

```py
while True:
    gint.dclear(bg)
    draw_logo(x, y, fg, bg)
    gint.dupdate()
```

Let‚Äôs break that down carefully.

---

### `gint.dclear(bg)` ‚Äî Clear the screen

This clears the entire screen before drawing the next frame.

If we don‚Äôt do this, the previous frame would stay visible and the screen would get messy.

- `bg` is the **background color**, usually white (`gint.C_WHITE`)

---

### `draw_logo(x, y, fg, bg)` ‚Äî Draw the logo

This draws the logo at position `(x, y)`.

- `fg` is the foreground color (used for the `#` characters)
- `bg` is used for the spaces
- The image is drawn starting from the top-left corner at `(x, y)`

---

### `gint.dupdate()` ‚Äî Display the frame

This updates the screen and actually **shows what you drew**.

Think of it like pressing "refresh" to make the drawing visible.

Without this, the image would be drawn in memory but not appear on the screen.

---

### Move the logo

After displaying, we move the image by updating its position:

```py
    x += dx
    y += dy
```

This simply means:
- `x += dx`: Move the logo horizontally by `dx` pixels
- `y += dy`: Move the logo vertically by `dy` pixels

For example, if `x = 50` and `dx = 2`, it becomes `x = 52`, and the image appears slightly more to the right on the next frame.

---

### Bounce off the screen edges

We want the image to **bounce** when it hits the edge of the screen.

Here‚Äôs how we check for that:

```py
    if x <= 0 or x + DVD_W >= gint.DWIDTH:
        dx = -dx
```

- If the left edge (`x`) goes off the screen
- Or if the right edge (`x + DVD_W`) goes past the screen width  
‚Üí Then we reverse the direction (`dx = -dx`)

We do the same vertically:

```py
    if y <= 0 or y + DVD_H >= gint.DHEIGHT:
        dy = -dy
```

This makes the logo **bounce** back the other way.

> Reversing the direction is what makes the logo move back and forth.

---

### Check if the user wants to exit

We don‚Äôt want this loop to run forever ‚Äî we let the user press the **EXIT key** to stop it.

```py
    ev = gint.pollevent()
    if ev.type == gint.KEYEV_DOWN and ev.key == gint.KEY_EXIT:
        break
```

- `gint.pollevent()` checks if any key is pressed (without freezing the program)
- If the key is `KEY_EXIT`, we `break` out of the loop
- That ends the program

> This check runs **every frame**, so the program stays responsive.

---

## Final Code

```py
import gint

DVD = [
    "                       ",
    "   ####    ####        ",
    "  #       #    #       ",
    "  #       #    #       ",
    "  #       ######   ### ",
    "  #       #            ",
    "  #       #            ",
    "   ###    #            ",
    "                       ",
    "  ####   #####  #   #  ",
    "  #   #  #      #   #  ",
    "  #   #  #      #   #  ",
    "  #   #  #####  #   #  ",
    "  #   #  #       # #   ",
    "  #   #  #       # #   ",
    "  ####   #####    #    ",
]

DVD_W = 23
DVD_H = 16

def draw_logo(x, y, color=gint.C_BLACK, bg=gint.C_WHITE):
    for dy in range(DVD_H):
        for dx in range(DVD_W):
            if 0 <= x+dx < gint.DWIDTH and 0 <= y+dy < gint.DHEIGHT:
                pixel = DVD[dy][dx]
                gint.dpixel(x+dx, y+dy, color if pixel == '#' else bg)

x, y = 50, 50
dx, dy = 2, 2
bg = gint.C_WHITE
fg = gint.C_BLACK

while True:
    gint.dclear(bg)
    draw_logo(x, y, fg, bg)
    gint.dupdate()

    x += dx
    y += dy

    if x <= 0 or x + DVD_W >= gint.DWIDTH:
        dx = -dx
    if y <= 0 or y + DVD_H >= gint.DHEIGHT:
        dy = -dy

    ev = gint.pollevent()
    if ev.type == gint.KEYEV_DOWN and ev.key == gint.KEY_EXIT:
        break
```
