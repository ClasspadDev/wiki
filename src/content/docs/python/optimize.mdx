PythonExtra is fast enough for real-time games ‚Äî **if you‚Äôre careful**.  
But if your app starts lagging, there are three usual culprits:

1. Drawing too much  
2. Inefficient algorithms  
3. Memory allocation & GC abuse

This page shows how to spot those issues and fix them, with **concrete examples**.

---

## 1. Avoid Unnecessary Overdraw

You can easily get 20+ FPS with full-screen redraws ‚Äî **as long as you‚Äôre not redrawing what doesn‚Äôt need to change.**

### ‚ùå Bad: Redrawing things you're about to overwrite

```py
# Clear the screen, then draw a full tileset right over it
drect(0, 0, DWIDTH-1, DHEIGHT-1, C_WHITE)

for y in range(0, DHEIGHT, 16):
    for x in range(0, DWIDTH, 16):
        drect(x, y, x+15, y+15, C_GRAY)  # Overwrites previous draw
```

You're wasting time filling pixels with white only to overwrite them immediately.

### ‚úÖ Better: Just draw the tiles

```py
for y in range(0, DHEIGHT, 16):
    for x in range(0, DWIDTH, 16):
        drect(x, y, x+15, y+15, C_GRAY)
```

Unless you *need* to clear parts of the screen (like UI or old objects), don‚Äôt redraw them.

## 2. Avoid Rebuilding Data Structures

Constantly creating new lists/tuples/objects every frame leads to **spikes in garbage collection**, especially if they‚Äôre small.

### ‚ùå Bad: Reallocating every frame

```py
# Builds a new list of coords every time
pixels = [(x * 10, y * 10) for x, y in snake]
```

This creates **N tuples per frame**, and GC hates it.

### ‚úÖ Better: Use preallocated buffers (but still not perfect)

```py
# Still makes tuples, but reuses the list
pixels = [(0, 0)] * 100

for i, (x, y) in enumerate(snake):
    pixels[i] = (x * 10, y * 10)
```

### ‚úÖ‚úÖ Even better: Use flat `bytes` or `bytearray`

```py
# 100 pairs = 200 bytes
buf = bytearray(200)

for i, (x, y) in enumerate(snake):
    buf[i*2] = x
    buf[i*2+1] = y
```

- `bytes`/`bytearray` are **4x cheaper** per value than tuples  
- Especially useful when values fit in 0‚Äì255 range (like grid coordinates or sprite IDs)  
- You get **CPU cache friendliness** and less GC overhead

## 3. Avoid Allocating Thousands of Small Values

If you're building a huge array of tiny tuples, you‚Äôre feeding the garbage collector a buffet of objects it has to track and clean.

### ‚ùå Bad: 1,000 tiny tuples

```py
positions = [(x, x) for x in range(1000)]
```

That‚Äôs 1,000 allocations ‚Äî and it gets worse if you do this in a loop.

### ‚úÖ Better: Use a flat array or shared buffer

```py
positions = bytearray(2000)

for i in range(1000):
    positions[i*2] = i % 256
    positions[i*2+1] = i // 4
```

- Uses one object instead of 1,000  
- Fits better in memory  
- No GC required

This trick is essential for tilemaps, image buffers, path grids, etc.

## 4. Avoid Doing Heavy Work Every Frame

### ‚ùå Bad: Sorting a list every tick

```py
def find_closest(entities):
    return sorted(entities, key=distance)[0]

# In the main loop
closest = find_closest(enemies)
```

Even for 30‚Äì50 items, this adds up fast.

### ‚úÖ Better: Cache or stagger expensive work

```py
if frame % 10 == 0:
    closest = min(enemies, key=distance)
```

Spread expensive calculations across frames, or only update when data changes.

## TL;DR ‚Äì What to Watch

| Problem              | Avoid this                        | Do this instead                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Overdrawing         | Clearing then overdrawing         | Only draw what‚Äôs visible/changed         |
| GC abuse            | Allocating lists/tuples constantly| Preallocate or use `bytearray`           |
| Algorithm bottlenecks | Sorting/pathfinding every frame | Update on timer or when needed only      |

## Extra Notes

- `drect()` includes both x2/y2 ‚Äî so full-screen is `drect(0, 0, DWIDTH-1, DHEIGHT-1, color)`
- `dupdate()` is mandatory to display changes. Call it once per frame.
- For input-heavy loops, `clearevents()` and `cleareventflips()` are your friends.
- Partial redraws (only updating specific screen regions) **can** improve performance but are tricky. Unless you‚Äôre drawing fewer than 3 things per frame, **full redraw is simpler and usually fast enough**.
