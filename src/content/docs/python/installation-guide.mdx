PythonExtra lets you write simple games and apps in Python on your ClassPad.  
Before you can use it, you need the Hollyhock mod installed and the correct PythonExtra file copied to your calculator.

---

## 1. Install Hollyhock

PythonExtra runs inside the Hollyhock environment. You need Hollyhock v2 or v3.

Follow the official installation guide:  
[https://classpaddev.github.io/#get-started](https://classpaddev.github.io/#get-started)

Make sure Hollyhock is working before proceeding.

## 2. Download PythonExtra

Choose the file that matches your Hollyhock version:

- For Hollyhock v3: **PythonExtra.hh3**  
- For Hollyhock v2: **PythonExtra-hh2.bin**

Download from:  
[https://classpaddev.github.io/python/#download](https://classpaddev.github.io/python/#download)

---

## 3. Copy the file to your ClassPad

Connect your calculator to your computer using a USB cable.  
Select **USB Mass Storage** on the calculator if prompted.

Copy the downloaded file (either `PythonExtra.hh3` or `PythonExtra-hh2.bin`) to the root folder of the calculator’s storage.

Safely disconnect the USB device from your computer.

---

## 4. Launch PythonExtra

On your ClassPad, go to the main menu and select **System** > **System** (the top‑left icon).  
Open the **Hollyhock launcher**.

You should see an entry named `PythonExtra` (or similar) in the list. Select it and press execute.

If the calculator freezes, press the reset button on the back, then double‑check that the filename is exactly `PythonExtra-hh2.bin` (for v2) and that it’s in the correct location.

---

## 5. Using PythonExtra

Once PythonExtra starts, you can browse for `.py` files written with the PythonExtra API.  
These files must be saved on the calculator’s storage.

If you run into any issues, check the filename, Hollyhock version, and ensure the file is in the root directory.
