# `turtle`: Fun with Graphics

The `turtle` module provides a simple and intuitive way to draw graphics. Imagine a small robot turtle that you can command to move around a canvas, leaving a trail behind it. You can change its direction, color, and whether it draws or not. It's a fantastic way to learn programming concepts by creating visual art.

To get started, you just need to import the module:

```py
import turtle
```

> Note: You need to download the [turtle.py](/python/turtle.py) file to the same location that you run your program...

## Turtle Motion

These commands control how the turtle moves around the screen.

### `forward(distance)` or `fd(distance)`
Moves the turtle forward by the specified `distance` in its current direction.

```py
# Move forward 100 steps
turtle.forward(100)
```

### `backward(distance)` or `back(distance)` or `bk(distance)`
Moves the turtle backward by the specified `distance`, opposite to its current direction.

```py
# Move back 50 steps
turtle.backward(50)
```

### `right(angle)` or `rt(angle)`
Turns the turtle to its right by the specified `angle` in degrees.

```py
# Turn right by 90 degrees
turtle.right(90)
```

### `left(angle)` or `lt(angle)`
Turns the turtle to its left by the specified `angle` in degrees.

```py
# Turn left by 45 degrees
turtle.left(45)
```

### `goto(x, y)` or `setpos(x, y)` or `setposition(x, y)`
Moves the turtle to an absolute position on the screen. The center of the screen is `(0, 0)`.

```py
# Go directly to the top-right area
turtle.goto(100, 50)
```

### `setx(x)`
Moves the turtle to the specified `x` coordinate, keeping its current `y` coordinate.

### `sety(y)`
Moves the turtle to the specified `y` coordinate, keeping its current `x` coordinate.

### `setheading(angle)` or `seth(angle)`
Sets the turtle's orientation to an absolute `angle`.
- `0` degrees points to the East (right).
- `90` degrees points to the North (up).
- `180` degrees points to the West (left).
- `270` degrees points to the South (down).

```py
# Make the turtle face upwards
turtle.setheading(90)
```

### `circle(radius, extent=360)`
Draws a circle or an arc. `radius` determines the circle's size. `extent` (in degrees) determines how much of the circle to draw.

```py
# Draw a full circle with a radius of 50
turtle.circle(50)

# Draw a semicircle
turtle.circle(50, 180)
```

### `home()`
Moves the turtle to the center of the screen `(0, 0)` and sets its heading to `0` degrees (East).

## Pen Control

These commands control the turtle's pen.

### `penup()` or `pu()` or `up()`
Lifts the pen up. The turtle will move without drawing.

### `pendown()` or `pd()` or `down()`
Puts the pen down. The turtle will draw as it moves.

### `pensize(width)` or `width(width)`
Sets the thickness of the line drawn by the turtle. A `width` of 1 is the default. The maximum is 5.

```py
# Make the line 3 pixels thick
turtle.pensize(3)
```

### `isdown()`
Returns `True` if the pen is down (drawing), and `False` if it's up.

## Turtle State

These commands manage the turtle's appearance and position.

### `hideturtle()` or `ht()`
Makes the turtle invisible. This is useful when you want to see only the drawing.

### `showturtle()` or `st()`
Makes the turtle visible again.

### `isvisible()`
Returns `True` if the turtle is currently visible.

### `shape(name)`
Changes the appearance of the turtle. Available shapes are `"classic"` (the default) and `"turtle"`.
```py
# Change the turtle's look
turtle.shape("turtle")
```

### `speed(speed)`
Sets the turtle's animation speed. `speed` can be:
- A number from 1 (slowest) to 10 (fast).
- `0` (fastest) means no animation; the drawing appears instantly.
- A string: `'slowest'`, `'slow'`, `'normal'`, `'fast'`, `'fastest'`.

```py
# Set a medium speed
turtle.speed(6)

# Make the drawing happen instantly
turtle.speed(0)
```

### `position()` or `pos()`
Returns the turtle's current `(x, y)` coordinates.

### `xcor()`
Returns the turtle's current `x` coordinate.

### `ycor()`
Returns the turtle's current `y` coordinate.

### `heading()`
Returns the turtle's current heading in degrees.

### `distance(x, y)`
Returns the distance from the turtle to the point `(x, y)`.

### `towards(x, y)`
Returns the angle (in degrees) from the turtle's current position to the point `(x, y)`. Useful with `setheading()`.
```py
# Make the turtle face the top-left corner
angle_to_corner = turtle.towards(-150, 80)
turtle.setheading(angle_to_corner)
```

## Screen Control

### `clear()`
Erases all drawings from the screen but leaves the turtle at its current position and state.

### `reset()`
This is a complete reset. It clears the screen, moves the turtle back to the center `(0, 0)`, and resets all its settings (color, pensize, etc.) to their defaults.

## Color Control

### `pencolor(*color)`
Sets the color of the line the turtle draws. You can specify a color in several ways:
- As a color name string: `"red"`, `"blue"`, `"green"`, etc.
- As an RGB tuple of floats from 0.0 to 1.0: `(1.0, 0.5, 0.0)`.

```py
# Set pen color by name
turtle.pencolor("blue")

# Set pen color with RGB values (for an orange color)
turtle.pencolor(1.0, 0.65, 0.0)
```

## Other Commands

### `write(text)`
Writes `text` on the screen at the turtle's current position.
```py
turtle.penup()
turtle.goto(0, 50)
turtle.write("Hello, Turtle!")
```
