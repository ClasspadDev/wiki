CInput is a quick and efficient way to create modern-looking input interface for your program in python. It handles all the stressful stuff like on-screen keyboards, scrollable lists, theming, and touch events, so you can focus on building legit add-ins without sweating the pixels position. 

Whether you're crafting a physics solver or just a custom note-taking app, CInput makes your app look premium out of the box.

## Download CInput

CInput is a single file library that's used to simplify common user inputs.
Latest stable version can [be downloaded on the Python store](https://classpaddev.github.io/python/store/index.html?type=utility)

## Wait, Why CInput?

Because nobody wants to hardcode `dtext` coordinates all day! You just call `cinput.input()` and boom, a themed on-screen keyboard drops in. You need the user to pick an option? `cinput.pick()` throws up a scrollable list. It's built for touch, it's fast, and it looks clean.
