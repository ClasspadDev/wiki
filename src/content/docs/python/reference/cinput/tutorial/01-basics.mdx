Ready to build something cool? This first tutorial walks you through everything from asking the user for text, prompting selection menus, and getting confirmations.

## 1. Asking Text Inputs

Stop manually drawing on-screen keyboards! Whether you need text, integers, or floating point numbers, `cinput.input()` handles everything, complete with touch-support and smooth themes.

```python
import cinput
from gint import *

# Just one line to summon the input keyboard!
name = cinput.input("Enter character name:", type="text", theme="dark")

# Then this is your code that handles the response : 
if name:
    dclear(C_WHITE)
    dtext(10,10, C_BLACK, f"Hello, {name}!")
    dupdate()

# Wait for key "<--" to exit
while True:
    ev = pollevent()
    if ev.type == KEYEV_DOWN and ev.key == KEY_DEL:
        break
```

Need numbers? Change `type="text"` to `type="numeric_int"` or `type="numeric_float"`. The keyboard instantly transforms into a clean numpad.

## 2. Choosing From Lists

Got multiple options for the user? Use `cinput.pick()`. It pops up a gorgeous, swipeable list box. You can even enable multi-select with checkmarks. 

```python
options = ["Start Game", "Load Save", "Settings", "Quit"]

# This halts execution until the user picks something.
choice = cinput.pick(options, "Main Menu", theme="light")

if choice == "Start Game":
    start_level()
```

**Pro-Tip:** Turn on `multi=True` in the arguments, and can pick multiple items before hitting OK.

## 3. The 'Are You Sure?' Dialog

You don't want someone accidentally deleting their 100-hour Pokemon save. Throw an elegant confirmation overlay right in their face using `cinput.ask()`.

```python
sure = cinput.ask("Delete Save?", "This action cannot be undone.", ok_text="DELETE", theme="light")

if sure:
    delete_everything()
```

You know the basics! If you're ready to put this into an actual app loop, check out the next tutorial.
