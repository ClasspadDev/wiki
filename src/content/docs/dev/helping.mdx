You want to take part of the project ? Here's a few pointers on how to !

## Creating content 
We'd be thrilled to have some of our work showcased in videos! If you're interested, let's discuss it on [Discord](https://discord.gg/knpcNJTzpd).
We also encourage you to spread the word about the games on Classpad and show off the cool things you do with it!


## Porting Games and Apps
We're always excited to welcome new people porting apps and games. Here are some examples of already ported games:

- [CPDoom](https://github.com/diddyholz/CPDoom): Doom on the calculator - [Read more](https://classpaddev.github.io/blog/)
- [CPBoy](https://github.com/diddyholz/CPBoy): A powerful Game Boy emulator - [Read more](https://classpaddev.github.io/blog/)
- [Flappy Bird](https://github.com/s3ansh33p/CPFlappyBird): The classical game on the Classpad

You can check [#Programs](https://classpaddev.github.io/#programs) for more

## Bringing Local Support
If you're part of a school or university where the Classpad is widely used and you're interested in modding, join our community! You can be a local guide for the Classpad.

## Studying the ROM
We need help discovering more GUI functions for the SDK. If you know assembly and ROM binaries, your expertise would be invaluable! 

*Please note that any work done on the ROM should not be published on the internet without being reviewed to prevent any intellectual property issues. You should agree to our code of conduct before submitting any PR publicly.*

## Connecting to the Web
We're planning to write a proper guide on how to use ESP and connect the Classpad to the internet. If you have experience with this or would like to test things, we'd love your help!
